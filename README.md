This is an example project using FF OS's manifest.webapp style of app development.

To use it simply start a http server in the _root_ directory:

    python run_server.py 
    Manifest URL: http://0.0.0.0:9100/manifest.webapp
    Serving app at http://0.0.0.0:9100/

You will be shown the simple-example.json form and can select any other .json
file in the dir to send SMS forms.
