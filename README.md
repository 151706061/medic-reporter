This is just a small example web project to test rendering the .json forms in this project.

To use it simply start a http server in the _root_ directory (one level up):


    python -m SimpleHTTPServer


then visit the following url:

    http://localhost:8000/web/

You will be shown the simple-example.json form. You will soon be able to select any other .json file in the root dir to test.
